# Not yet, but we have a few things.

## Quantum Computer Cloud Service Bindings
[q1tsim](https://github.com/Q1tBV/q1tsim)
A gate-type simulator crate, that not just simulates, but
exports your circuits to Open QASM and C-Qasm, the former 
being understood by IBM's Q Experience.

## Simulation & Circuit Design
[quantum](https://github.com/beneills/quantum)
A 5-qubit gate-type quantum computing simulator crate built for education.
It introduces you to the world of quantum simulator building by both code and documentation.

[rusq](https://github.com/hajifkd/rusq)
A gate-type quantum computing simulator inspired by Microsoft's Q#.

[rust-libquantum](https://github.com/mknyszek/rust-libquantum)
The Rust binding to libquantum, [a quantum simulator written in C](https://github.com/libquantum/libquantum).

[RustQIP](https://github.com/Renmusxd/RustQIP)
A gate-type simulation framework designed with graph building in mind.

[unitary-quantum-simulator-rust](https://github.com/atilag/unitary-quantum-simulator-rust)
According to the project page: Rust version of the Unitary Simulator found in the Python QISKit.
Brought to you by Juan Gomez, member of the [IBM Research](https://github.com/IBMResearch) team.

## Post-Quantum Cryptography
[liboqs-rust](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-rust)
Rust bindings to liboqs, a [C package](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/) for quantum-safe KEM and digital signature alorithms.

[pqcrypto](https://github.com/rustpq/pqcrypto)
The Rust bindings to the C-implementations of quantum-safe encryption algorithms proposed to the NIST 
[during this competition](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography).
